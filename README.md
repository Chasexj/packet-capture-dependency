# packet-capture-dependency
This repository contains the dependencies that can be used to correcty format header fields in single pcap packet or streams of packets belong to the same flow/session.
This contains tree-structured representations of (1) intra-packet header field value dependencies and (2) inter-packet header field values dependencies in single network communication flow/session.
Current protocols supported include IPv4, TCP, UDP, and ICMP.
