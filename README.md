# packet-capture-dependency
This repository contains documentation on the dependencies that can be used to correctly format header fields in a single pcap packet or streams of packets belonging to the same flow/session.
This contains tree-structured representations of (1) intra-packet header field value dependencies and (2) inter-packet header field value dependencies in a single network communication flow/session.
Current protocols supported include IPv4, TCP, UDP, and ICMP.
